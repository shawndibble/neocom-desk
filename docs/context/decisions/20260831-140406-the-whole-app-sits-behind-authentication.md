# Scope decisions (round 4)

_Recorded 2026-08-31._

- **The whole app sits behind authentication.** Every feature route requires a
  signed-in Character; only `/login`, `/callback` and the hidden `/styleguide`
  are reachable without one. Other EVE tools are fully open without auth, so we
  are not competing on that, and requiring a Character removes a class of
  anonymous-state handling from every view.
- **Auth-required and scope-required are separate.** A route can need a login
  but zero ESI scopes — `/market` reads only the SDE snapshot and Fuzzwork.
- Missing-scope handling is centralized, not per view: the **scope gate**
  compares the stored grant against the route's required scopes before any
  fetch, and a **runtime auth-failure sink** covers the window where that
  stored grant is stale (a revoke performed in EVE's third-party-application
  portal is invisible locally until the next token refresh).
- Multi-scope routes (`/overview`, `/skills/trained`, `/industry`) must degrade per
  panel rather than gating the whole page — one missing scope must not hide the
  panels that still work. Partly done: Overview's wallet panel degrades; its
  skills and queue panels, and the Skills and Industry panels, still fall back
  to an empty state and rely on the runtime auth-failure notice.
