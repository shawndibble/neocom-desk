# Scope decisions (round 10)

_Recorded 2026-08-31._

- The market catalogue payloads are kept **out of the install precache** and
  fetched on first visit to the Market Browser. Offline order books are not a
  thing the network can give us anyway, so paying ~1.2 MB on every install for
  a page most users never open is the wrong trade.
- An order row answers to its own context menu — copy the location, copy the
  price, show the item, and **filter the book down to that one station**, which
  is the move the whole tool exists to support.
- The Quickbar is a flat, drag-ordered list. Folders would be a second synced
  data model for what is a shortcut bar.
- Market group names and attribute names stay in English: they are game data,
  not UI copy. Only the app's own labels pass through i18next.
