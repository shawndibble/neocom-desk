# Scope decisions (round 5) — Market Browser rebuild

_Recorded 2026-08-31._

- **Two-column Market Browser**: left column is find-an-item (search box +
  Market Group tree + Quickbar); right column is the selected item.
- **Order source swaps to ESI region order books.** `/markets/{region_id}/orders`
  is public — `/market` still requires zero ESI scopes, so the round-4 decision
  holds in spirit while its "SDE snapshot and Fuzzwork only" wording is
  superseded. Build Plan keeps Fuzzwork (amends ADR 0002).
- **Buy and sell are separate tables**, never one blended list.
- **No "All Regions" option.** ESI has no cross-region endpoint; it would cost
  100+ requests per item.
- **New lazy-loaded SDE payloads** for `/market` only: Market Group tree and
  the published market types. `types.json` stays as it is, so Skills and
  Industry do not pay for the market catalogue.
- **Player-structure orders are shown, never hidden.** Their names need a scope
  the app does not take, so they render as an unknown structure — but with the
  solar system and security status, which the order payload always carries.
  Hiding the rows would misreport the best price.
- The selected item also offers **variations** for price comparison and an
  **item detail modal** (fitting attributes: CPU, powergrid, volume, bonuses).
