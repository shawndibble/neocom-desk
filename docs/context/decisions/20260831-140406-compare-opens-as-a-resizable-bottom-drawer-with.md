# Scope decisions (round 8)

_Recorded 2026-08-31._

- **Compare opens as a resizable bottom drawer**, with a persistent
  `Compare (N)` handle and an expand-to-full-view control. Comparing happens
  _while_ browsing — a modal or a tab would hide the order book the user is
  cross-referencing on every single add.
- **Recharts draws the price history**, loaded only when its tab is opened.
  TanStack Charts is pre-alpha and not a production choice.
- **Search filters the tree in place**: the hierarchy stays, and a branch is
  hidden when nothing under it matches. It does not become a flat result list.
- **Narrow screens show one column at a time** — the finder, then the item, with
  a back control. Desktop keeps both columns side by side.
- With nothing selected, the item column prompts the user to search or browse.
  No stand-in default item.
